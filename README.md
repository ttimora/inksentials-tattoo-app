# Inksentials Tattoo App

This repository contains a minimal React Native skeleton for the **Inksentials** mobile application. The project is designed to be expanded with features like forum discussions, social media feeds, a shop and marketplace, membership subscriptions, podcast streaming, an art gallery, and an admin dashboard.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (requires Node and npm):

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Expo development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The current implementation provides placeholder screens for each major section. Use this as a starting point to build out the full feature set.
